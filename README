Angelia is the Greek spirit of messaging. It wraps all accesses to a
serial port, by way of LD_PRELOAD and tunnels them through a local XBee
in API mode to send the data to a remote XBee in AT mode.

The focus at the moment is on supporting avrdude remote programming on the
SparkFun XBee Shield and Series 2 XBees.

Things we need to look at to do this are:
 - Handling DTR to reset remote Arduino
 - Changing the baud rate
 - Forwarding data in packets
